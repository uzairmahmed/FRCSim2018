# FRC Unity Simulator 2018
*Made with 🤖❤️ by Uzair Ahmed and Shaurya Manocha*\
**This is simply made to test strategies and timing. While basic physics stuff work, don't expect it to be accurate. IF YOU WANT ACCURATE, USE THE REAL ROBOT**

## Bugs
- LAN games work 25% of the time
- Red Portal does not work
- Climber goes crazy sometimes

## TODO
- Add Starting Cubes
- Edit Low Goal Colliders
- Fix LAN networking
- Fix Portals


## How to Run the Simulator
1. To run the simulator, download the folder and open in Unity, then click `File > Build & Run`. *(Alternatively, if you have the Simulator folder, download it and run `FRCUnitySim.exe`. (Make sure the `UnityPlayer.dll` file and `FRCUnitySim_Data` folder is in the same directory)).*
2. Set the Resolution and Quality and click `Play!`
3. Click `LAN Host` or type `H` for SinglePlayer mode, or to run as Server. Click `LAN Client` or type `C` to join a LAN game.
4. Play!

## How to Play
- After spawning, pick up a PowerCube or spawn it through a portal, drop it onto a high or low goal. 
- Thats pretty much it.
